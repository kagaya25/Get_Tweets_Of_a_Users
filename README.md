## Python Script to Download Tweets

Use the script `get_tweets.py` to download the last 100 tweets (or whatever number you choose) from any Twitter user.

### Setup
(1) You need to get your Twitter API Credentials by creating a new app at [developer.twitter.com](developer.twitter.com).

(2) This script uses Tweepy. If you don't have Tweepy installed you need to run this command on the terminal first:

```
$ sudo pip install tweepy
```
